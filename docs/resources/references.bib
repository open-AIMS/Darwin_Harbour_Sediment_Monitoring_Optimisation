abstract="In this paper, a modified version of continuous simulated annealing is proposed as a tool for optimizing spatial sampling schemes at the point level. Spatial information on the sampling area, stored in a GIS, can be dealt with as constraints to the optimization process. Maps and earlier measurements can be handled as pre-information. The algorithm can distinguish different quantitative optimization criteria. In this paper, two criteria will be presented. The first ensures optimal estimation of the variogram, by reproducing a pre-specified point-pair distribution over distance- and direction classes. Compared to a previous study, the algorithm produced dramatic improvements. The second criterion aims at even spreading of the sampling points over the area. Here, the algorithm always did better than a triangular grid, especially in areas with much sampling constraints, where improvements could be up to 30{\%}. Combination of the criteria in a phased sampling procedure is possible.",
